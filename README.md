# AUE8230Spring24_Jagadeesh
Hi, I am Jagadeesh Madinni and this is my repository for all things ROS as part of the Autonomy: Science and Systems course.

The repo template is based on packages since each assignment/project is expected to have its own package. The general layout is as follows:
catkin_ws
    |
    ---build
    ---devel
    ---src
        |
        ---Assignment_package_name
            |
            ---include
            ---launch
            ---src
            ---scripts
            ---videos
            ---CMakeLists.txt
            ---package.xml
            ---README.md
